        <p>I am a product manager with an interest in programming.</p>
        <p>I have over 7 years of product management experience. Now I am branching out into what it takes to code projects!</p>
    <h3>Why am I learning to code?</h3>
        <p>In my 7 years of experience, I've worked on several technical teams and I never quite understood all the effort it takes to code the requirements I gather. <br>
        In order to be a better product manager, I wanted to understand how my fellow engineers work. I'm also very interested in the technical side of things! <br>
        Throughout my portfolio, you'll see my progression as I learn to scratch the surface of how engineers work.
